As I write this, a flood of emotions overwhelms me. It feels as though those days and nights spent weaving code are flashing before my eyes. Those lonely yet fulfilling times, like stars twinkling in the night sky, illuminated my path forward.

At times, I found myself lost in the maze of programming, facing endless challenges alone. The intricate algorithms and elusive bugs were like dense fog, obscuring my direction.

The pressure of preparing for the high school entrance exams and high school studies surged through my heart like a torrential river. In the intertwining of textbooks and code, I struggled to find a balance.

Sometimes, I would solve math problems under the dim light of late night, preparing for the upcoming exams;

Other times, I would immerse myself in the ocean of code all day, pondering deeply for a perfect program.

Although I was exhausted, the sense of fulfillment and satisfaction made me feel that all the efforts were worthwhile.


It was an honor to represent Chifeng City and Chifeng No. 2 High School in the National Student and Teacher Information Literacy Improvement Practice Activity.


**Thank you! Thank you, my teachers, friends!**

**Thank you, the one in front of the screen**


YOU AND ME FOR THE FUTURE
