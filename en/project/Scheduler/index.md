## Background

I researched similar software in the app market and found an application called "Progress". After contacting the author and obtaining authorization, I referred to the features and operational logic of the original software. With deep consideration and careful programming, I completed this software. This software is developed based on Vite and using Visual Studio Code.

This is a computational thinking project aimed at creating a web application that allows users to record their daily tasks (such as progress, goals, and counts) and focus on one thing at a time. My goal is to provide users with a convenient, efficient, and aesthetically pleasing scheduling tool experience.

## Software Highlights

### Clear Operational Logic and Efficient Scheduling

Using `Index DB` technology, efficiently implementing a "database" on the front end. The software is divided into the main page, archive page, and settings page (recycle bin, dark mode, user instructions, etc.);

### Beautiful Program Animations and Interface

Designed with a light skeuomorphic, fresh, and minimalist style to make users feel comfortable.

### Efficiency and Maintainability

The source code of the software reflects the consideration of efficiency and maintainability during development. The code is clean, efficient, and logically clear, written in a modular style. It uses front-end technologies to ensure it can run on any device with a browser, reducing the barrier to entry. (For detailed content, see the README.MD in the source code directory)
